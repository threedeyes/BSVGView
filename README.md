# BSVGView
A simple view for rendering SVG images natively in Haiku.

BSVGView is a lightweight component for embedding vector graphics into your Haiku applications. It uses the popular single-header parser nanosvg to parse SVG data and renders it using standard Haiku API calls within the BView::Draw() method.
